Before running the script, ensure to update the input and output paths located at the beginning of the script.

This script is designed to convert Xbox 360 xex folders to zar format while keeping the original xex folder intact.

You'll need to have double the storage space of the xex files available. Here's some advice:

- Make sure you have enough storage space: Allocate at least twice the size of the xex folder to accommodate the original xex files, the generated zar file, and temporary files.
- Plan for storage: If storage space is limited, consider converting one xex folder at a time to manage space effectively.
